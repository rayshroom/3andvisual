Hosting some pet projects/effects, mainly 3D, may be done in three.js


## Some preliminary ideas

1. 3D Data Visualization Dashboard
	•	Description: Create an interactive 3D chart to visualize a dataset (e.g., population growth, COVID-19 stats, stock market trends, or website traffic).
	•	Features:
	•	Bar chart, line graph, or scatter plot in 3D space.
	•	Add axes and grid for clarity.
	•	Interactive tooltips that display detailed data when hovering over points.
	•	Use animation to emphasize changes over time (e.g., animate growth or movement in real time).
	•	Tools:
	•	Dataset: Use a public API (e.g., financial or weather data).
	•	OrbitControls for navigation.
	•	Advanced:
	•	Add transitions between different chart types (e.g., bar to line).
	•	Integrate post-processing for a polished look.

2. Interactive 3D Product Showcase
	•	Description: Showcase a 3D model of a product (e.g., a smartphone, car, or sneaker) with realistic textures, lighting, and interactivity.
	•	Features:
	•	Users can rotate and zoom the model.
	•	On hover or click, display information pop-ups (e.g., specifications or features).
	•	Include animation for product highlights (e.g., explode view for parts or a spinning animation).
	•	Tools:
	•	Use a GLTF model (from platforms like Sketchfab or self-created).
	•	Add realistic PBR materials and HDR lighting.
	•	Advanced:
	•	Include a color or style configurator (e.g., change the color of a car or customize a shoe).

3. 3D City Builder or Map Viewer
	•	Description: Build an interactive 3D map with procedurally generated buildings and terrain.
	•	Features:
	•	Generate a simple city layout with cubes or loaded models.
	•	Add terrain, roads, and trees.
	•	Include a camera control for users to fly through the city.
	•	Optionally add weather effects (rain, fog, or sun).
	•	Tools:
	•	Procedural generation using Perlin noise or a JSON map file.
	•	OrbitControls or FlyControls.
	•	Use post-processing for effects like depth of field or fog.
	•	Advanced:
	•	Add interactivity, such as clicking on buildings to get information or triggering animations.

4. 3D Portfolio or Resume
	•	Description: Create a 3D portfolio or resume that highlights your skills and projects in an interactive and creative way.
	•	Features:
	•	Display floating cards or objects for each project.
	•	Add animations to transition between different sections (e.g., education, experience, skills).
	•	Include interactive elements like clickable icons or links.
	•	Tools:
	•	Custom geometries or GLTF models to represent projects (e.g., a computer for web development or a globe for travel).
	•	Smooth camera transitions between sections using the Three.js animation system.
	•	Advanced:
	•	Create a timeline with draggable interactions or autoplaying animations.

5. 3D Music Visualizer
	•	Description: Build a 3D music visualizer that reacts to audio input in real-time.
	•	Features:
	•	Use Three.js geometries (e.g., cubes, spheres, or particles) that react to audio frequencies.
	•	Synchronize color changes or lighting effects with the beat.
	•	Include a UI to let users upload their own audio.
	•	Tools:
	•	Use the Web Audio API to analyze audio input.
	•	Use shaders or particles for advanced visuals.
	•	Advanced:
	•	Create a VR mode using WebXR for an immersive experience.
